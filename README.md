# Veil

**A proxy client for HarmonyOS NEXT that tells the truth about its state and does not die in the background.**

Veil is a from-scratch replacement for ClashBox. The UI is ArkTS; the engine is a
Go library (`libveil.so`) loaded through NAPI; the tunnel is a `vpnExtension`
tun device handed to the engine as a file descriptor.

## Why Go is usable on HarmonyOS

HarmonyOS NEXT runs a Linux kernel. A Go program that only uses the standard
library plus `golang.org/x/*` builds for `GOOS=linux GOARCH=arm64` with the
OpenHarmony NDK clang (`--target=aarch64-linux-ohos`) and links against the
device libc. Veil ships it as a C shared library and calls it from ArkTS via
NAPI, exactly like the mihomo-based client does — but with a much smaller,
auditable core. This was verified in this repository's build script:

```bash
scripts/build-core.sh          # produces entry/src/main/libs/arm64-v8a/libveil.so
```

## Feature set

- **Protocols**: VLESS (REALITY, XTLS-Vision), VMess (AEAD, alterId 0), Trojan,
  Shadowsocks (AEAD-2022 + legacy AEAD), Hysteria2 (QUIC).
- **Transports**: TCP, TLS 1.3 with browser fingerprints, REALITY, WebSocket
  (early data), gRPC, HTTP/2.
- **Import**: `vless://`, `vmess://` (standard JSON *and* legacy
  `base64(user@host:port?query)`), `trojan://`, `ss://` (SIP002), `hysteria2://`,
  subscription URLs (base64 or plain), pasted Clash YAML.
- **Routing**: ordered rules (domain / suffix / keyword / regex / CIDR / geoip /
  port / network / process / final), policy groups (select, url-test, fallback,
  load-balance), global/rule/direct modes.
- **DNS**: UDP / TCP / DoT / DoH upstreams, TTL cache, per-server detour, DNS
  hijack inside the tunnel.
- **Observation**: live connections with per-connection byte counters, latency
  probes, real traffic rates, log ring buffer.

## Why it won't rot

The failures of the original client were lifecycle bugs, not protocol bugs.
Veil treats the process as a supervised service:

1. **One state machine.** `stopped → starting → running → degraded/stopping →
   failed`. Every transition carries a reason string. The UI renders the state;
   it never infers "connected" from an optimistic flag.
2. **Health is measured, not remembered.** A watchdog goroutine ticks every
   second; the supervisor reports the age of the newest tick, goroutine count,
   open descriptors, heap size and restart count. A stalled tick is itself a
   failure signal.
3. **Nothing is allowed to panic into the void.** Every connection handler,
   listener and background loop runs under `recover()`; listener failures are
   restarted with exponential backoff; fatal engine errors restart the engine
   with a bounded, announced backoff instead of silently dying.
4. **Everything has a deadline and an owner.** Connections are registered with
   context cancellation, idle timeouts and a hard cap; shutdown drains them.
   A 30-minute soak test asserts that goroutines return to baseline.

## Building

```bash
# host tests (protocols, routing, supervisor soak)
cd core && GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.27.3 go test ./... -count=1

# HarmonyOS arm64 core (writes entry/libs/arm64-v8a/libveilcore.so)
scripts/build-core.sh

# HAP (compile + package; signing config is optional for a local build)
DEVECO_SDK_HOME=/Applications/DevEco-Studio.app/Contents/sdk \
JAVA_HOME=/Applications/DevEco-Studio.app/Contents/jbr/Contents/Home \
NODE_HOME=/Applications/DevEco-Studio.app/Contents/tools/node \
/Applications/DevEco-Studio.app/Contents/tools/hvigor/bin/hvigorw \
  --mode module -p module=entry@default assembleHap --no-daemon
```

### Install

The HAP is unsigned by default. Open the project in DevEco Studio once and let
it create a debug signing config (Project Structure → Signing Configs), or sign
`entry/build/default/outputs/default/entry-default-unsigned.hap` with your own
certificate, then install with `hdc install <hap>`.

On first start the app asks the system to start its VPN extension. The status
card shows `核心不可用` with the real error if the extension or the native core
cannot start — it never shows a false "connected".

## Verification status

| Target | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Go unit + integration | `cd core && go test ./...` | see `docs/TESTING.md` for the matrix |
| REALITY interop | `go test ./e2e -run TestReality -v` | passes against the official `github.com/xtls/reality` server |
| Whole data path | `go test ./e2e -run ThroughEngine -v` | SOCKS5 → engine → VLESS/REALITY → echo |
| Stability | `go test ./internal/supervisor -run Soak` | 1440 connections, goroutines return to baseline |
| arm64 OHOS core | `scripts/build-core.sh` | `libveilcore.so`, ELF aarch64, links only libc |
| App package | `hvigorw assembleHap` | HAP contains `libs/arm64-v8a/libveil{,.so,core.so}` |

Known limits are listed at the bottom of `docs/TESTING.md` (no live carrier
tests, the VPN extension cannot run on a desktop).
